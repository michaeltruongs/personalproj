            <p>Hello! My name is Michael. I have been fortunate to travel all of the places I have been to. It has allowed me to see many perspectives
                of all lives. But if I were to look inward, there would be two parts of me. A technical side and a business side. Showcasing both sides below in the form of departments.

        <h3>Clothing Brand (WIP)</h3>
        <p> I'd have always wanted to create a streetwear clothing brand. One that I would be proud to wear as it is a projection of me. 
            It would take inspiration from Gentle Monster, Takashi Murakami, and Vwoolo. Quality materials and limited stock to eliminate environmental waste.
            All of my clothing brand details are hazy but it's on the way.

    <div class="subsection-header">
        <h3>Content Creation</h3>
        <p>In my free time, I like to play games. Occasionaly, I would stream on Twitch. Providing live entertainment is really unique as you have
            a live audience in real time. Content creation of mine will eventually head towards short-form content such as Tiktok and Instragram reels.

    <div class="subsection-header">
        <h3>Business Plans</h3>
        <p>Throughout my educational career, I have written a variety of business plans both international and domestic.
            These involve identifying a need to coming up with a solution to the problem. From that solution
            to marketing to finacial forecasting as well as risk forecasting. I've been through all the stages of the business plan.
            In Highschool, my partner and I presented an Armenian Garbage Company to Colorado DECA State competition. The Armernian Garbage Company addresses
            that people in Armernia don't have a solid way to get ride of their waste. During my Business minor capstone, our group came up with "On the Right Track"
            which addresses how students may not understand their school degree audit and with that mistake, they might take unnecessary classes which might prolong their college career to 5 to 6 years.
            Sometimes academic adviors are unhelpful as well. On the Right Track keeps students aware of their academic process and help them achieve the 4 year timeline.
